The Lego WeDo is a tethered-over-USB sensing and robotics toolkit produced by Lego for the educational market.

It's supported by Scratch(on Windows and OSX) and by Lego's proprietary software(on Windows, and, in theory, the XO Laptop).

It prominently features the [LB1836](http://semicon.sanyo.com/en/ds_e/EN3947F.pdf) motor driver and the [LM358](http://www.national.com/ds/LM/LM158.pdf) op-amp, as well as an epoxy blob with USB support.
